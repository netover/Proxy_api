# Background Task Cancellation and Resource Leakage Prevention

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of proper background task cancellation and resource leakage prevention in the LLM Proxy API. The system ensures that background tasks are properly cancelled on shutdown and don't leak resources.

## Problem Statement

The original codebase had several issues with background task management:

1. **Fire-and-forget tasks**: Some components created `asyncio.create_task()` calls without storing references, making them uncancellable
2. **Resource leaks**: Tasks created without proper lifecycle management could continue running after application shutdown
3. **Inconsistent cancellation**: Not all background tasks were properly cancelled during shutdown

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AsyncLRUCache (`src/utils/context_condenser.py`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `_background_tasks` set to track all background tasks
- Added `_shutdown_event` for coordinated shutdown
- Modified `set()` and `clear()` methods to store task references
- Added proper task cleanup with `task.add_done_callback()`
- Enhanced `shutdown()` method to cancel all pending tasks

**Key Features:**
```python
# Task tracking and cleanup
self._background_tasks: set = set()
self._shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()

# Store task references
task = asyncio.create_task(self.save())
self._background_tasks.add(task)
task.add_done_callback(self._background_tasks.discard)

# Proper shutdown
if self._background_tasks:
    for task in list(self._background_tasks):
        if not task.done():
            task.cancel()
    await asyncio.gather(*self._background_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### 2. Existing Proper Implementations

The following components already had proper cancellation mechanisms:

- **UnifiedCache** (`src/core/unified_cache.py`): Stores `_cleanup_task`, `_warming_task`, `_monitoring_task`
- **ProviderFactory** (`src/core/provider_factory.py`): Stores `_health_check_task`
- **ParallelFallbackEngine** (`src/core/parallel_fallback.py`): Proper task cancellation in execution methods
- **Main application** (`main.py`): Cancels remaining tasks in lifespan shutdown

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `tests/test_background_task_cancellation.py` with 14 test cases covering:

- **AsyncLRUCache Cancellation Tests:**
  - Background task tracking
  - Shutdown cancellation
  - Task cleanup on completion
  - Redis eviction task cancellation

- **UnifiedCache Cancellation Tests:**
  - Start/stop lifecycle
  - Task cancellation on shutdown
  - Warming task cancellation

- **ProviderFactory Cancellation Tests:**
  - Health monitoring cancellation
  - Shutdown event handling

- **ParallelFallbackEngine Cancellation Tests:**
  - Execution cancellation
  - Active execution cleanup

- **Resource Leakage Detection Tests:**
  - Task leakage detection
  - Memory usage tracking

- **Graceful Shutdown Tests:**
  - Task cancellation on shutdown

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Task Reference Management
```python
# Always store task references
self._background_tasks.add(task)
task.add_done_callback(self._background_tasks.discard)
```

### 2. Proper Cancellation Handling
```python
# Cancel tasks and wait for completion
for task in list(self._background_tasks):
    if not task.done():
        task.cancel()

await asyncio.gather(*self._background_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### 3. Exception Safety
```python
# Handle CancelledError gracefully
try:
    await task
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    logger.info(f"Task {task} was cancelled")
```

### 4. Shutdown Coordination
```python
# Use shutdown events for coordinated shutdown
while not self._shutdown_event.is_set():
    # Task logic here
    await asyncio.sleep(interval)
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_background_task_cancellation.py -v
```

All 14 tests should pass, verifying:
- Proper task lifecycle management
- Resource cleanup on shutdown
- Leakage prevention
- Graceful cancellation handling

## Benefits

1. **Resource Leak Prevention**: No background tasks leak on shutdown
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Application shuts down cleanly without hanging tasks
3. **Memory Safety**: Prevents accumulation of cancelled but not cleaned up tasks
4. **Debugging**: Better visibility into background task lifecycle
5. **Performance**: Prevents resource exhaustion from leaked tasks

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging
Background task cancellation is logged for monitoring:
```
INFO: Cancelling 3 background tasks
INFO: All background tasks cancelled
```

### Metrics
Consider adding metrics for:
- Number of active background tasks
- Task cancellation rate
- Shutdown cleanup time

## Future Improvements

1. **Task Naming**: Add descriptive names to tasks for better debugging
2. **Timeout Handling**: Add configurable timeouts for task cancellation
3. **Health Checks**: Add health checks for background task health
4. **Metrics Integration**: Integrate with existing metrics system
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Add circuit breakers for task creation limits

## Compatibility

This implementation is backward compatible and doesn't change any public APIs. Existing code continues to work while benefiting from improved resource management.
