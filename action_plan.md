- [ ] Implement automatic failover mechanisms
- [ ] Add health check aggregation for all providers

### 2. Improve Exception Handling
- [ ] Add graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Implement request queuing for rate limiting
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

## Priority 4: Performance Optimizations (Medium)

### 1. Add Caching Layer
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequent requests
- [ ] Add cache warming strategies
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation policies

### 2. Optimize Connection Pooling
- [ ] Adjust connection pool parameters based on usage
- [ ] Add dynamic connection lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement connection monitoring

## Priority 5: Maintainability Improvements (Medium)

### 1. Reduce Code Duplication
- [ ] Refactor common patterns into shared utilities
- [ ] Consolidate error handling logic
- [ ] Standardize metrics recording

### 2. Standardize Logging
- [ ] Implement structured logging with trace IDs
- [ ] Standardize log formats and levels
- [ ] Add distributed tracing support

## Priority 6: Testing and Documentation (Low)

### 1. Expand Test Coverage
- [ ] Add security testing
- [ ] Implement performance and load testing
- [ ] Add integration testing for failure scenarios

### 2. Improve Documentation
- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples
- [ ] Implement configuration hot reloading

- Successful penetration testing results

### Performance Metrics
- 50% reduction in average response time
- 99.9% uptime for healthy providers
- Cache hit rate > 80% for frequent requests

### Reliability Metrics
- < 1% failure rate for provider requests
- < 5 second recovery time after provider failures
- 100% successful health check aggregation

### Maintainability Metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### Dependency Update Risks
- Update one dependency at a time
- Run comprehensive tests after each update
- Maintain rollback plans for critical updates

### Implementation Risks
- Use feature branches for major changes
- Implement gradual rollouts for critical features
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions

### Operational Risks
