# TODO for Building HWA Dashboard Executable

- [x] Ensure PyInstaller is installed (install if needed in virtual environment)
- [x] Install Pillow for icon conversion
- [x] Run PyInstaller with build.spec to create 'hwa_dashboard.exe'
- [x] Test the executable by running it and verifying the dashboard opens
