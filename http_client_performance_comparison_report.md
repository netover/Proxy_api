| 30s vs 25s delay | 0.0% | 0.0% | 11577.93ms | 10919.84ms | +5.7% |

**Analysis:**
- V2 shows significant improvements in timeout handling efficiency
- Best improvement (41.7%) in scenarios with short timeouts and slow responses
- V2's adaptive timeout handling prevents unnecessary delays

### 4. Throughput Performance

**Test Configurations:**
- Low Concurrency (10 concurrent, 100 total requests)
- Medium Concurrency (50 concurrent, 500 total requests)
- High Concurrency (100 concurrent, 1000 total requests)

**Results:**

| Configuration | V1 RPS | V2 RPS | V1 Avg Response | V2 Avg Response | V2 Connection Reuse |
|---------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Low (10 conc) | 3.97 | 3.97 | 816.42ms | 851.72ms | 98.3% |
| Medium (50 conc) | 18.63 | 18.57 | 1048.23ms | 1160.96ms | 99.6% |
| High (100 conc) | 36.93 | 36.87 | 895.50ms | 840.26ms | 99.8% |

**Analysis:**

    max_connections=1000,
    keepalive_expiry=60.0,
    timeout=30.0,
    retry_config=RetryConfig(
        max_attempts=3,
        base_delay=1.0,
        max_delay=30.0,
        jitter=True
    )
)
```

### V2 Optimal Settings for Low Latency:

client = AdvancedHTTPClient(
    max_keepalive_connections=50,
    max_connections=200,
    keepalive_expiry=30.0,
    timeout=10.0,
    retry_config=RetryConfig(
        max_attempts=2,

## Conclusion

The AdvancedHTTPClient (V2) provides significant improvements in connection efficiency, adaptive retry strategies, and monitoring capabilities while maintaining comparable throughput performance. The choice between V1 and V2 depends on specific application requirements, with V2 being the recommended choice for production deployments requiring high reliability and performance monitoring.

**Key Recommendation**: Migrate to V2 for production use cases where connection efficiency and adaptive error handling provide the most value. The performance improvements in connection reuse (96-99%) and timeout handling efficiency (15-40%) justify the minor overhead increase.
