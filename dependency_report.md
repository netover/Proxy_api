## Recommendations

1. **Critical Updates**:
   - fastapi: Major version update (0.104.1 → 0.116.1)
   - uvicorn: Major version update (0.24.0 → 0.35.0)
   - pydantic: Major version update (2.5.0 → 2.11.7)

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Updating these dependencies may resolve known security vulnerabilities
   - Some dependencies are several major versions behind

3. **Compatibility Testing**:
   - Thorough testing is recommended after updating
   - Pay special attention to breaking changes in major version updates

4. **Update Strategy**:
   - Update development tools first (black, ruff, pytest)
   - Update core dependencies incrementally
   - Update pyinstaller last as it may require build script adjustments
